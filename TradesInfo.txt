Based on the provided information, I have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of various trading models using OHLCV data for BTC/USDT across different timeframes. Here are the key points and findings:

**Technical Deliverables:**

I have access to OHLCV data for BTC/USDT at various timeframes, ranging from 3 minutes to 6 hours. These timeframes allow me to analyze and develop trading strategies with different levels of granularity.

**Submission Rules:**

Trading signals should be submitted in binary format: 1 for entering a long trade and -1 for entering a short trade, while 0 indicates no signal. Trades are executed on the closing of timestamps, regardless of long or short signals.

**Position Sizing Approaches:**

Two position sizing approaches were provided: static and compounding. Static involves using a fixed amount (e.g., $1,000) for each trade, while compounding adjusts the trade size based on the previous trade's outcome, allowing capital to grow or shrink arithmetically with each trade's result.

**Profit and Loss (PNL) Formulas:**

PNL formulas for both long and short trades were outlined, taking into account entry and exit prices. PNL is calculated based on a fixed investment amount (e.g., $1,000) and represents the profit or loss from a trade based on the price difference between entry and exit.

**Max Dip in Running Trade:**

A formula to calculate the maximum dip percentage in a trade was provided, considering the lowest price during the trade. This metric helps assess the drawdown or risk associated with a trade.

**Model Development and Results:**

Trading models were developed using various algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM, VAR, GRU-RNN, and Deep Q Network. The maximum win rate achieved among these models is approximately 52.48%, while the minimum win rate observed is 3%. 

Detailed statistics were provided for the RF + ARIMA model, including gross profit, net profit, total closed trades, win rate, max drawdown, average trade outcomes, and various ratios like Sharpe and Sortino ratios. For LSTM, a win rate of 52% was achieved, while XGBoost achieved a 35% win rate.

Overall, this analysis showcases a thorough exploration of different trading models and strategies, highlighting the varying win rates and performance metrics. This information can be valuable for optimizing trading strategies and assessing their profitability.
